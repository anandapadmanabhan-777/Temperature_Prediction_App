# Temperature_Prediction_App
 This app predicts the temperature based on historical data
 ----

- Developed a CNN-RNN Hybrid Model for time-series forecasting to predict daily temperatures based on historical weather data.
- Leveraged CNN for spatial feature extraction and RNN for capturing temporal dependencies, enhancing prediction performance.
- Built an interactive web app using Streamlit, enabling users to input real-time weather data for next-day temperature predictions.
- Integrated weather metrics such as dew point, humidity, wind speed, visibility, and pressure for accurate forecasting.
- Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Streamlit
